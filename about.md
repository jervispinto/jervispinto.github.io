## Jervis Pinto

My primary interests are artificial intelligence, machine learning and its applications in developing beneficial, adaptive, self-optimizing software. My research projects typically occur at the intersection of machine learning, sequential decision making and software engineering.

I'm very grateful for the opportunity to work with experts in machine learning as well as software engineering. My thesis advisor is [Prof. Alan Fern](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~afern/) and we collaborate frequently with [Prof. Alex Groce](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~alex/).

The best way to contact me is via email: *jervis.pinto@gmail.com*

### Research Areas

#### Improving search performance in large MDP's (NSF)

In large decision problems, even sophisticated search algorithms will often perform poorly. In this project, we design algorithms that learn control knowledge from past planning experience in the form of partial policies. We develop new imitation learning algorithms for learning partial policies and analyze their regret bounds. The partial policies are used to prune actions in large MDP's during tree search which results in significantly better decision making in less time. See our [paper]({{site.url}}/assets/pinto2014learning.pdf) at UAI14. (*With Alan Fern*)

#### Improving automated testing with search and learning (NSF)

Can ML be used to improve automated software testing? In this project, we design algorithms for improving the runtime/coverage profile of automated test harnesses. Towards that end, we are developing a a domain-specific template scripting testing language [TSTL](https://code.google.com/p/harness-maker/source/checkout) which allows a developer to succintly define a test space using a very high-level DSL. See our [paper]({{site.url}}/assets/groce2015little.pdf) at NFM15 for an introduction to TSTL. (*With Alan Fern and Alex Groce*)

#### Adaptation-based programming (NSF)

We developed an intuitively simple programming model for integrating reinforcement learning into modern programming languages. The resulting API enables developers who may not be reinforcement learning experts to easily write self-optimizing programs that learn over mulitiple executions. The resulting ABP library was used by networking experts to write adaptive network protocols and by automated testing experts to write new test harnesses. (*With Alan Fern, Martin Erwig, Thinh Nguyen, Alex Groce, Tim Bauer and Patrick Zhu*)

#### Transfer Learning and Its Application to Learning to Play American Football (DARPA)

We were the first stage of the transfer learning task. Our task was to automatically track players in raw footage and label those tracks with durative semantic labels. The result was the first end-to-end system capable of observing raw video and learning high-level concepts and was featured in AI Magazine. (*With Alan Fern and Rob Hess*)

### Industry Experience

#### HP Labs, Palo Alto, CA

I interned with the [analytics lab](http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/analytics/) at HP Labs in Palo Alto in summer 2013. I developed a learning assistant for helping non-programmers compose cloud analytics workloads on the [farm](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2465250&dl=ACM&coll=DL&CFID=549337679&CFTOKEN=83161052) (i.e., next-generation cloud analytics systems).

#### Brightscope Inc., San Diego, CA

I spent the summer of 2012 in San Diego at a financial-services startup on a challenging information extraction problem of extracting financial data from arbitrarily formatted text and image documents.
